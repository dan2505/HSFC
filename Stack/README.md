# ðŸ“š Stack

A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is an example of an abstract data type which follows a **LIFO** order _(Last in, first out)_.

It has two primary operations: 
* **push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
* **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

## Data Integrity
In order to maintain the integrity of the data, the data structure is private. The structure can then only be manipulated through the public methods.
